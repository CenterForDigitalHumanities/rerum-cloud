## An Open Exchange

This application (RERUM for short) provides an open repository for the storage of
annotations and abstract objects related to Digital Humanities and
Cultural Heritage studies. Use of this repository is voluntary and
without warranty, but all efforts towards continued support and
open access are made. At the moment, this repository is supported
entirely by the Walter J. Ong, SJ Center for Digital Humanities at
Saint Louis University. This project is open for contribution or
cloning on
[github.com](https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum-cloud).
All data submitted to RERUM is technically open and discoverable, but
is not required to be interesting. GCS Datastore is an object/document
NoSQL-style database with no enforced schema, but JSON-LD would be nice.

## Authorization and Use

In the spirit of openness, RERUM
absolutely trusts registered applications, but does not independently
authenticate clients. Once an application is [registered](register.md), the
API key becomes the path to verification. As the repository and her
associated tools mature, it will become simpler to filter results by
trusted groups, though in most cases, applications will find only the
objects for which they are looking.
